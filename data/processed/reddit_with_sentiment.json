    "title": "$3M on Unity - My DD for U",
    "body": "**Position**     \n\n3000 call options for January 2026 with a 30 USD strike price; you can also see in my previous postings that I hadn’t sold when we were at almost $40 and then when it went all the way down, I added to my Unity position. \n\n  \n**Disclaimer**\n\nThis isn’t financial advice. This is all just for your entertainment.\n\n**TLDR of the TLDR**\n\nUnity can do an AppLovin stock move if Unity’s new AI-Powered ad Platform Vector succeeds. So far, Vector has “far exceeded our expectations” according to the CEO Bromberg 1 week ago. My 1 year price target is $200. That would represent around half of AppLovin’s current market cap; their main competitor in the ad space. Unity powers 70% of mobile games with their engine (Unity software is on 2.5 billion devices - you read that right, read it again and maybe one more time. This also includes the China market… ), but until Vector they haven’t really capitalized on this potential moat. In the short-term gamma squeezes and even a short squeeze (9.28% shorted) are possible because various whales are buying OTM call options en masse and up to 88.26% of Unity is institutionally held and most positions have been made when the stock was over $100 (according to Fintel) which creates illiquidity as institutions likely won’t want to sell a turn-around stock in a bull market when they are still in the minus. In other words, if you bet on Unity, you are riding together with the whales. And if you think gaming has a future and ads will play a role, especially on mobile phones and VR (60% of VR games are made with Unity), and you are still here, you might as well read my intro and the TLDR. \n\n  \n[https://images.fintel.io/us-u-so.png](https://images.fintel.io/us-u-so.png) \n\n  \n**About me**\n\nI went from 27k to 5M+ in less than 2 years (see my previous posts on WSB), but I also lost 180k back in the SPAC days and had to start again from scratch. This taught me that I should only invest in undervalued  companies that have some sort of actual moat. Previously I went with long-term calls into PLTR at around $8 and then into SOFI at around $7 (which btw at that time people also argued were overvalued). Unity is my third and only play. The rest I have in cash. My life hasn’t changed much (only my parents know and 2 friends), but whatever happens, I’ll be able to create an animal shelter for homeless dogs and other animals. \n\n**TLDR**\n\nUnity is a turn-around, it has almost 0 interest from the retail community (try yourself and search on YouTube or X if anything received lots of interactions in the recent 1-2 years. This is good, because we are so early that no popular finfluencer is covering it), it’s actually even hated among retail because of Unity’s previous management and its runtime fee non-sense. Since their new CEO Bromberg took over 15 months ago, Unity not only reversed the runtime fee decisions, but also double beat on their earnings each time. Last week they did it again and analysts all upgraded Unity stock based on the most recent quarter. Still the stock is beaten down when you look at the 5 year chart (Unity used to trade above $200). I am not a technical trader, but I like beaten down stocks that are in the accumulation zone for years while the underlying company double beats each quarter and keeps growing. I like it even more when we are now witnessing the first great results of an AI product that hasn’t even started yet - Vector. It reminds me of when Palantir introduced their AIP bootcamps, their game changer. Ok, I tricked you. The TLDR of the TLDR and this TLDR are actually just an introduction. You might as well read the rest now. At least try to read the next sentence and see if it gets you hooked for more. \n\n**AppLovin, Unity’s main competitor**\n\nAppLovin (Ticker APP - check out what their stock did in the last 12 months as inspiration) tried to buy Unity in 2022 for $58.85 per share and Unity rejected because they much rather wanted to compete with AppLovin in ads since Unity has the better moat (they provide the engine on which the games run). Based on some rumors they tried buying them a second time last year. However often AppLovin really tried to buy Unity, I am relieved that I could still invest in Unity. \n\n**Secret whale(s)**\n\nIn the background there’s an investor or multiple investors that have been putting $40M+ in the last few weeks on Unity OTM call options. Whoever that is, they got balls of steel as they are riding all ups and downs like a madman and keep accumulating. Yesterday alone around $10M was added to this Friday’s options chain. If Unity holds above $37.50 until Friday, we might see a gamma squeeze. Also, with up to 90% institutional ownership, where the majority is way underwater, thus likely not selling (which makes the stock illiquid) and Unity being almost 10% shorted, we might see a short squeeze. It’s not my main investment thesis, but definitely fun to watch this unfold. It’s still a big if, so don’t bet on it.      \n\n**Unity and AppLovin experts**\n\nIf you don’t believe me because I am just claiming to be a wizard and can’t even write wizard, make sure to invest 3 hours of your time to watch 2 podcasts of the GameMakers (one is from Apr 8, 2025 and the other one is from June 10th, 2025; you can find it on YT) and watch how they are slowly changing their opinion full of skepticism towards Unity’s new Vector platform to seeing some potential opportunity for Unity to then 5 days ago Josh Chandley, Co-Founder at WildCard (mobile) Games, posting this:\n\n  \n[https://www.linkedin.com/posts/joshchandley\\_%F0%9D%97%A8%F0%9D%97%BB%F0%9D%97%B6%F0%9D%98%81%F0%9D%98%86%F0%9D%98%80-%F0%9D%98%80%F0%9D%98%81%F0%9D%97%BC%F0%9D%97%B0%F0%9D%97%B8-%F0%9D%97%B1%F0%9D%97%BF%F0%9D%97%BC%F0%9D%97%BD%F0%9D%97%BD%F0%9D%97%B2%F0%9D%97%B1-%F0%9D%9F%B2-activity-7359210962823909376-VEah/?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=member\\_desktop&rcm=ACoAAAGIzIkBUdZilpoVRXo18tu0TjDzcMZLfr8](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/joshchandley_%F0%9D%97%A8%F0%9D%97%BB%F0%9D%97%B6%F0%9D%98%81%F0%9D%98%86%F0%9D%98%80-%F0%9D%98%80%F0%9D%98%81%F0%9D%97%BC%F0%9D%97%B0%F0%9D%97%B8-%F0%9D%97%B1%F0%9D%97%BF%F0%9D%97%BC%F0%9D%97%BD%F0%9D%97%BD%F0%9D%97%B2%F0%9D%97%B1-%F0%9D%9F%B2-activity-7359210962823909376-VEah/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAAGIzIkBUdZilpoVRXo18tu0TjDzcMZLfr8) \n\n  \nAnd have a look who is liking this. Multiple employees in senior roles at Unity wouldn’t outright confirm any numbers obviously (they like to sandbag and then doublebeat at the earnings). So, feel free to have a look at this LinkedIn posting and check for yourself how many Unity employees liked that posting. It’s around 50+ Unity employees. Here’s one senior employee:\n\n  \n[https://ibb.co/0RfpB8YB](https://ibb.co/0RfpB8YB)\n\n  \n**Unity partners**\n\nNot surprisingly as the biggest engine provider in the world Unity is partnered with Apple, Google, Microsoft, Nintendo, Meta (for the Oculus) and Sony (for the PlayStation), but also with Tencent to help developers bring more games to China. They are also partnered with lots of other companies, even multiple car manufacturers (Mercedes-Benz, Toyota etc.) to create 3D models.\n\n**Macro cycle**\n\nWe never know what Trump is up to and if we will get the next recession this year, next year or with the next president. But what we know is that we are at all-time-highs. Typically in all-time-highs the more speculative and smaller cap stocks go up. Unity fundamentally isn’t a highly speculative stock, but it is perceived as one. So, even if you think that we will soon have a recession, Unity might as well go up in the short-term. For the intermediate term in case of a recession, millions of people losing their jobs would cause what? 4 years ago when people lost their jobs and were at home they were playing (mobile) games and many programmers also created games. This was the time when Unity stock was above $200. And now with generative AI it will be even easier to create new mobile games. Unity is still the best game engine for new developers. In short, I am not too worried about Unity even if a recession hits anytime soon.  \n\n**Unity red flag:**\n\nYes, I am honest here. There’s also something critical about Unity. I am fine with stock-based-compensation. That’s normal for such companies to keep talent and attract more talent. But when I read through Glassdoor reviews, Unity employees emphasize the great work-life-balance… Sorry, but if any Unity employees read this: AppLovin has eaten your breakfast, lunch and dinner in the last few years. True, you previously had really bad management. But now with your CEO Bromberg and Vector you have a real chance to eat their dessert. That’s the best food anyway. So, in the next 9-12 months keep pushing like never before to get it! I believe in unity. You have been waiting for this long enough.   ",

Kind of like \"for every action, there is an opposite reaction\".\n\nThen the insane melt-up crashes back down.

We could be somewhere in between these two sides of the spectrum:\n\n1- We could be on the very flatline before a major parabolic melt-up that will dwarf all this year's price action.\n\n2- Or this could be a milder melt-up like 2021, and we could be already more than halfway into a milder parabolic run.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/svds08t8ssif1.jpg?width=830&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=334bd7ba1758ca8503485ca4673887438249cac3\n\n# What perfect storm of events could help fuel a melt-up?\n\n**-Fear desensitization: heavy market fear for over a year, but with no consequences as the price still gets new ATHs:**\n\nFirst off, it always helps when the market has already had most of its major fear out of the way.\n\nAnd it might even have been increasingly desensitized from fear.\n\nThe market has already gone through months in recent years of fears of threats of nuclear war, major recession, tariff wars, Covid variants, economic trouble all around the world, along with monthly crypto FUD we had for over a year, from the crypto banking collapse to the recent XMR fear of a 51% attack. It's been one after another.\n\nThere's been an overload of fear, now mostly blown over, that will make it difficult to out-do.\n\nIt might even turn into a boy who cried wolf situation, even if there is legitimate fear coming up.\n\nEspecially now that people see that despite all the fear we had, it didn't stop Bitcoin from going past $120K.\n\n**-M1 M2 money supply** has been climbing more sharply, and is forecast to continue this trend. While Bitcoin has been falling behind. This is probably the trend that the crypto market has loved following the most, historically.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qgwqv4nrusif1.jpg?width=1166&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=04d22d419f5044fbbaff9ecb8f964be1a03b7f42\n\n**-Fed rate cuts.**\n\nFed cuts haven't even started yet. It's unlikely we have even seen the biggest gains yet without any cuts started.\n\n**- Crypto ETFs, 401Ks, sovereign funds, coporate funds, etc...**\n\nThere's more and more of these big funds loading up on crypto. And some have only just started. It's starting to also look like they might be moving into alts also.\n\n**-Continuously pro-crypto US government, along with other nations warming up to crypto.**\n\nThe US government has continued its pro-crypto policies, as seen with its most recent bills to help the crypto space. But if you look around the world, it's not the only government that's increasingly more pro-crypto. One interesting area are the Gulf States, which haven't been talked about much, but seem to be increasingly pro-crypto, and are rumored to be working on their own crypto sovereign funds.\n\n**-FUD and negative narratives are fading from mainstream media, and getting increasingly replaced by hype.**\n\nThere is still the occasional FUD story, but if you look at when mainstream media has talked about crypto these past months, it's decreasingly less about \"scam\" and \"criminal money\" narratives, and increasingly more about \"big gains\", \"bull market\", \"technology\", \"pro-crypto policies\".",

    "title": "What Is Value and Price, and Why Bitcoin’s Price Will Keep Rising",
    "body": "We all know the words “value” and “price”, but what do they really mean, and what’s the difference between them? Why are some things worth millions while others are worth nothing at all? What role do society, resources, time, and even culture play in shaping these concepts?\n\nLet’s start with definitions:\n\n**Value** – a subjective perception of the importance, usefulness, or significance of something. It’s the “why” behind why something matters or doesn’t.\n\n**Price** – a quantitative expression of value (usually in money), showing exactly how much something costs in numerical terms.\n\nFor example: the item with the highest value to a human – water – has a low price in most regions, while a useless memecoin has no real value at all but may sometimes carry a high price.\n\n# Types of Price\n\nPrice is a tool for measurement and exchange.\n\n**Exchange value** – the foundation of a market economy, showing how much other goods or money one can get for an item.  \nExample: 1 BTC = 110,000 USD or 1 BTC = 1,617 barrels of oil. In a market economy, exchange value is driven by market price, determined by supply and demand.\n\n**Imputed value** – the estimated value of a good or service based on expert calculation, analogy, or assumed usefulness rather than market mechanisms. Used in government policy, ecosystem service evaluation, social policy, tender bids, and in valuing public goods where market-based pricing is impossible.\n\n**Cost price** – the sum of all actual expenses incurred to produce and deliver a product or service to the consumer. It includes raw materials, labor, equipment depreciation, rent, energy, taxes, and other costs. It defines the minimum price at which a product can be sold without incurring a loss.\n\n**Intrinsic value (fair value)** – a theoretically justified valuation of an asset, company, or project based on fundamentals: profits, cash flows, assets and liabilities, growth prospects, and market risks.  \nExample: An investor calculates that a company’s stock is worth $100, but it trades at $70. He concludes it’s an undervalued asset and buys.\n\n# Types of Value\n\nValue is multidimensional and can be classified both by its source and by how it’s perceived.\n\n**Utilitarian value** – usefulness, ranging from life-essential (water, food, oxygen) to nearly useless (souvenirs) and even negative utility (harmful items like cigarettes). The price of highly useful goods depends on time and place. For example, a bottle of water is cheap almost everywhere, but in a desert emergency its price can skyrocket.\n\n**Emotional value** – tied to personal feelings or memories, such as a childhood toy or a gift from a loved one. For most people, such an item is worthless, but for one person, it can be priceless.\n\n**Cultural value** – connected to history, art, and tradition. This includes antiques, vintage items, and objects that represent important symbols (religious, national, etc.).\n\n**Social value** – what’s important in the eyes of others. These are status-signaling items like luxury watches, expensive cars, or limited-edition sneakers. Often, the brand and scarcity are the main drivers of price.\n\n**Existential value** – things that cannot be expressed in monetary terms: freedom, life, love, worldview.\n\n# Factors Affecting Price\n\nHere are 15 key factors that shape the final price:\n\n1. Production costs (cost price)\n2. Rarity\n3. Supply and demand (plus liquidity)\n4. Competition\n5. Government regulation\n6. Logistics\n7. Technological level\n8. Brand and image\n9. Marketing and packaging\n10. Consumer psychology\n11. Traditions and culture\n12. Currency exchange rates\n13. Inflation\n14. Financial bubbles\n15. Geopolitics and crises\n\n# Why Bitcoin’s Price Will Rise\n\nBitcoin is a completely new asset class. It’s not a commodity, stock, or bond, so traditional valuation methods like intrinsic value or fair value don’t apply.\n\nWhat it does have: cost of production, average market price, trading volumes, and liquidity.\n\nBitcoin through the 15 price factors:\n\n1. Cost price – driven by mining costs, mainly electricity and taxes. Halving increases cost price over time.\n2. Rarity – supply limited to 21 million BTC; decreasing over time due to lost keys.\n3. Supply and demand – 560M crypto holders, $10–20B spot volume, $40–60B with futures & ETFs. ETFs expand access.\n4. Competition – altcoins are not real competitors; the only rival is gold.\n5. Government regulation – U.S. acceptance is a global green light; states and companies now hold BTC.\n6. Logistics – irrelevant except for transaction fees.\n7. Technology – debated, but simple, reliable, decentralized.\n8. Brand – Bitcoin is the most recognized cryptocurrency.\n9. Marketing – best ad is rising price.\n10. Consumer psychology – Veblen effect boosts demand.\n11. Traditions & culture – BTC is culturally neutral.\n12. Currencies – correlated with USD.\n13. Inflation – makes BTC attractive, especially in high-inflation countries.\n14. Bubbles – Bitcoin thrives in speculative growth cycles.\n15. Geopolitics – potential to behave like gold in crises.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nBitcoin is almost the perfect asset for price growth, as it checks nearly all key factors driving value higher. The only serious threats are mining pool collusion (51% attack) and quantum computing, both unlikely in the near term. Other risks may cause short-term drops but aren’t existential.\n\nP.S. This is not financial advice but a philosophical reflection on the nature of value and price, and how Bitcoin relates to the main factors influencing asset prices. Always make decisions based on your own market analysis.",

    "title": "$BLSH IPO DD",
    "body": " Key Financial Metrics\n1. Revenue:\n   - Trailing 12 Months (ended March 31, 2025): $167 million, as reported in IPO-related filings.\n   - Fiscal Year 2024: $250.26 billion, a 114.80% increase from $116.51 billion in the prior year. This figure seems unusually high and may reflect a reporting error or inclusion of trading volume rather than operational revenue. Most sources align with the $167 million figure for recent revenue, suggesting the $250.26 billion may be a typo or misinterpreted data (possibly total trading volume or assets under management). For clarity, the $167 million figure is more consistent across sources.\n\n2. Net Income:\n   - Q1 2025 (three months ended March 31, 2025): Net loss of $349 million, compared to a profit of $105 million for the full year of 2024.\n   - Q2 2025 (estimated for three months ended June 30, 2025): Net income estimated between $106 million and $109 million, driven largely by favorable changes in the fair value of digital assets rather than operating income.\n   - Full Year 2024: Earnings of $78.53 million, a 93.96% decrease from the prior year, indicating volatility in profitability.\n\n3. Assets:\n   - Liquid Assets (as of March 31, 2025): Bullish holds over $3 billion in liquid assets, including:\n     - 24,000 Bitcoin\n     - 12,600 Ether\n     - Over $418 million in cash and stablecoins\n     - Minor amounts in decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols (not material to the total).\n   - The significant digital asset holdings expose Bullish to price volatility in cryptocurrencies, which directly impacts its balance sheet.\n\n4. IPO Proceeds and Valuation:\n   - IPO Size: Bullish aims to raise up to $990 million by offering 30 million shares at $32–$33 per share (upsized from an initial 20.3 million shares at $28–$31).\n   - Valuation: At the top of the price range ($33), Bullish would have a market valuation of approximately $4.82 billion, with a fully diluted market cap of $4.3 billion at the midpoint of the initial range.\n   - Use of Proceeds: Intended for general corporate purposes, potential acquisitions, and conversion of a portion of proceeds into U.S.-dollar-denominated stablecoins.\n\n5. Expense Structure:\n   - Specific expense breakdowns (e.g., operating expenses, cost of revenue) are not detailed in the provided sources. However, the significant Q1 2025 loss ($349 million) suggests high operational or market-related costs, potentially due to:\n     - Infrastructure costs for running a high-volume crypto exchange (e.g., technology, cybersecurity).\n     - Regulatory compliance expenses, as Bullish holds licenses from bodies like the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission and the German Federal Financial Supervision Authority.\n     - Costs associated with CoinDesk operations (media, events, and data services).\n   - The shift from a $105 million profit in 2024 to a $349 million loss in Q1 2025 indicates potential exposure to digital asset price fluctuations, as fair value changes significantly impacted Q2 2025 net income.\n\n6. Trading Volume:\n   - Bullish Exchange’s total trading volume since launch (2021) exceeded $1.25 trillion as of March 31, 2025. This is not revenue but reflects the platform’s activity level, which drives transaction fees and liquidity services revenue.\n\nCapital Structure\n- Shares Offered: 30 million ordinary shares with a nominal value of $0.002 per share, with an additional 4.5 million shares available via an underwriters’ option.\n- Pre-IPO Equity:\n  - Restricted Stock Units (RSUs): Bullish Global RSUs will convert into 200,046 ordinary shares post-IPO.\n  - Stock Options: Bullish Global Options will convert into options to acquire 6,058,701 ordinary shares at a weighted average exercise price of $17.80, subject to vesting conditions.\n- Investor Interest: Funds managed by BlackRock and ARK Investment Management have indicated interest in purchasing up to $200 million of shares at the IPO price (33% of the initial offering).\n\n### Financial Analysis\n- Revenue Growth: The $167 million revenue figure for the trailing 12 months (ending March 31, 2025) reflects operational scale, but the $250.26 billion reported for 2024 is likely a misinterpretation of trading volume or a reporting error. The lower figure aligns with a crypto exchange’s typical revenue model (transaction fees, liquidity services).\n- Profitability Volatility: The swing from a $105 million profit in 2024 to a $349 million loss in Q1 2025, followed by an estimated $106–$109 million profit in Q2 2025, highlights significant earnings volatility, likely due to digital asset price fluctuations.\n- Balance Sheet Strength: The $3 billion in liquid assets (Bitcoin, Ether, cash, and stablecoins) provides a strong liquidity buffer but ties financial health to crypto market performance.\n- Valuation Concerns: At $4.82 billion, the valuation is lower than the $9 billion targeted in the failed 2021 deal but still considered premium by some analysts compared to peers like Coinbase, especially given recent losses.\n\n### Gaps and Limitations\n- Incomplete Expense Data: No detailed breakdown of operating expenses, cost of revenue, or capital expenditures is available in the provided sources. Full financial statements in the SEC Form F-1 (filed August 4, 2025, and amended) would provide more clarity.\n- Profitability Drivers: The reliance on fair value changes in digital assets for Q2 2025 net income suggests that operating income may be weaker than reported earnings imply.\n- Peer Comparison: Bullish defines its peer set as Coinbase, Kraken, LMAX, Gemini, and itBit, but specific financial comparisons (e.g., revenue multiples, profit margins) are not provided.\n- Post-IPO Performance: As BLSH began trading on August 13, 2025, real-time financial updates or post-IPO quarterly results are not yet available in the sources.\n\n### Sources for Further Research\n- SEC Filings: Access Bullish’s Form F-1 and amendments on the SEC’s EDGAR database (www.sec.gov) for complete financial statements, including income statements, balance sheets, and cash flow statements.\n- Company Reports: Check Bullish’s investor relations page (if available post-IPO) for updated financials.\n- Market Data: Use platforms like Yahoo Finance, Nasdaq, or Bloomberg for real-time stock price and trading volume data.\n- Analyst Reports: Renaissance Capital, CoinDesk, or Reuters may provide deeper financial analysis post-IPO.\n\n### Conclusion\nBullish (BLSH) shows significant revenue ($167 million for the trailing 12 months ending March 31, 2025) and a robust liquidity position ($3 billion in assets), but its financials reflect volatility, with a $349 million loss in Q1 2025 and an estimated $106–$109 million profit in Q2 2025 driven by digital asset valuations. The $4.82 billion IPO valuation is ambitious, and the lack of detailed expense data limits a full assessment of its cost structure. Investors should review the latest SEC filings for comprehensive financials and monitor post-IPO performance for clearer insights into operational efficiency and profitability. The crypto market’s volatility and regulatory risks remain key considerations.",

The company told The Wall Street Journal that several investors including large venture-capital funds had agreed to back the transaction in full.\n\n>Estimates of Chrome’s enterprise value vary widely but recent ones have ranged from $20 billion to $50 billion.\n\nI would think that the valuation would be worth even more, this is probably just an opening salvo.\n\nGoogle pays Apple approximately $20 billion per year to remain the default search engine on Apple devices, including the Safari browser on iPhones, iPads, and Macs. The anti-trust ruling might force Google to spin off Chrome, but Google will likely appeal any decision, so this is going to be stuck in court for a long time. I'm not sure what this offer achieves but Perplexity has a lot of guts going for it.",

They took zero risk in that trade. When banks or corporations screw up, they get bailouts paid for by our taxes. When you win, they take a cut. When you lose, they vanish.\n\nMonero fixes that.

No blockchain trail, no reporting, no “oops, I forgot to declare my gains” with your name all over a public ledger.\n\nAnd for those who support drug legalization… you can talk all day about how the war on drugs is bad and how the free market should decide, but if you aren’t using the tech that actually makes that possible right now, you’re just talking. Monero enables that market today.\n\nWhen talking about tax avoidance and drugs, most Monero users see it as a flaw and try to hide it. They'll say “oh it’s only a small percent of the volume” or “fiat is worse.” Screw that. The answer should be “fuck yes it’s used for this, that’s the point” and “fuck taxes, fuck government overreach” and “what does your shitcoin do for the average person?”\n\nWe took the risk with crypto, it could have gone to zero.
